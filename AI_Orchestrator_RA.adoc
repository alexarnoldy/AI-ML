#### Rough notes

.Artificial Intelligence Business Challenge
* AI/ML/DL market is exploding in both new applications and new technologies
* What it lacks is an adequate supply of qualified Data Scientists and AI Operators
** This forces Data Scientists to spend time learning to adapt their models to specific AI Platforms
** It also leaves AI Operations without the ability to effectively manage the comapany's AI Platforms 
** It also adds friction in adopting new AI platforms in the form of excessive time to value
** It also means adopting new AI Platforms won't return value until Data Scientists adapt their models to the new platform

.SUSE AI Orchestrator Business Value
* When SUSE set out to create a new, indispensible tool for its customers, we followed three primary guidelines:
** Ensure Data Scientists are able to stay focused on creating, analyzing, and refining their data models
** Return control of the AI Platforms, and the expendatures on them, to AI Operations
** Enable new avenues of collaboration between Data Scientists and AI Operators
