#### Rough notes

.The Business Challenge of Artificial Intelligence Projects
* AI/ML/DL market is exploding in both new applications and new technologies
* What it lacks is an adequate supply of qualified Data Scientists and AI Operators
** This forces Data Scientists to spend time learning to adapt their models to specific AI Platforms
** It also leaves AI Operations without the ability to effectively manage the comapany's AI Platforms 
** It also adds friction in adopting new AI platforms in the form of excessive time to value
** It also means adopting new AI Platforms won't return value until Data Scientists adapt their models to the new platform
* Many Data Scientists, and even AI Operations teams, will gravitate to one or two AI platforms rather than take on the challenge of onboarding and proving another technology. When we look at the different applications needed for data management, notebooks/workspaces, workflow and lifecycle management, and more; the task of bringing in new technologies can be overwhelming.



.SUSE AI Orchestrator Business Value
* When SUSE set out to create a new, indispensible tool for its customers, we followed three primary guidelines:
** Ensure Data Scientists are able to stay focused on creating, analyzing, and refining their data models
** Return control of the AI Platforms, and the expendatures on them, to AI Operations
** Enable new avenues of collaboration between Data Scientists and AI Operators

.Random Thoughts
* DS has to adapt her model into a pipeline for a specific platform
** Often an effort of trial and error to find the right combination of code and runtime options
** SAIO allows DS to create model in their development platform of choice 
** DS points SAIO to their AI/ML model in any Git repo 
** DS collaborates with AIO to determine the needs of the model and the priority (and thus the requied cost) of the analysis
** SAIO figures out how to adapt the model to the chosen platform
** Any errors found in the model can be fixed in the Git repo and the analysis re-run immediately
** End result is that DS doesn't need to know anything about the AI Platforms and AI Operations can help DS run the model on the platform that best fits the need at that moment

.A Closer Look: The Data Scientist
* The Data Scientist is the most important element in any Artificial Intelligence inititive. The more time she can spend creating, analyzing, and refining her data models more chances of success the project will have. Unfortunately, the reality is that there are several other elements of the project that will siphone off her time. Several of these come in the form of the well known https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5656-hidden-technical-debt-in-machine-learning-systems.pdf[Hidden Technical Debt of Machine Learning Systems]. With the persistent lack of qualified AI Operators, solving the elements of technical debt often falls on the shoulders of the Data Scientist.
* Many Data Scientists prefer to build, and initally test, their models on a powerful workstation. This gives them full control of the AI platform and tends to work well for the initial process of creating a model. However, to fully vet a data model, often a much larger data set, and thus much more computing power is required. 
* The translation that occurs at this stage is the first of many stumbling blocks that will distract any Data Scientist from improving their data model. Once the data model is runable on a more powerful AI platform, the project can tend to stick to that platform, even when it might not be the optimal one. The desire to advance the stages of a project rather than, yet again, adapt the data models to a new platform can slow productivity and eventually doom the project entirely. What is desparetly need is the flexibility to run data models on various AI platforms in a highly dynamic way. By automatically adapting the data model to the chosen AI platform, SUSE AI Orchestrator relieves the Data Scientist of the burden of learning each AI platform and lets him focus on what he does best.

.A Closer Look: The AI Operator
* The challenges faced by an AI Operations teams extend beyond just creating and maintaining AI platforms. A productive AI Operations team can help Data Scientists is find the AI platform that meets the needs of the project, at its current stage, while maintaining a predictable cost curve for the computing resources consumed. Unfortunately, often the AI Operator doesn't know enough about the needs of a particular stage of a project, just as the Data Scientists often don't know the breadth of AI platforms available to them. 
* Cost over-runs have become an accepted standard of new AI/ML projects. One of the problems a company faces is the lack of resources avaialable to align the cost of an AI platform with what's needed for the exact stage of an AI project. SUSE AI Orchestrator endeavors to fill that gap by giving the Data Scientist the ability to request various resources and the AI Operator the ability to assign a anaylsis run to the most cost effective AI platform that meets the needs. This massively accelerates time-to-results for the Data Scientists and allows the AI Operations team to keep costs appropriate to the needs of the project.
